# Brain colours

## Background

Colour maps used in scientific litterature must reflect the underlying data. The problem with many maps is that while underlying values are represented by different colours (as red-green-blue values) they are not perceived as such. This is explained by the fact that human do not perceive colours in a uniform fashion, and that most colour maps have colour and luminance confounded. One solution is the make map in CIELAB (Luminance A:red-green B:blue-yellow) space. I share here usual maps but with luminance fixed (linearized as much as possible) based on Peter Kovesi paper and code: 'Good Colour Maps: How to Design Them' [arXiv:1509.03700](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03700)

## Data and Code

This repository contains the Malab code used to generate colour maps as well as the maps as .csv, .mat and .lut files

## Dependencies

- Initial colour maps are taken from [MRICro](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron)
- .lut fules are read using Matthew Brett's pr_getcmap.m function (slover in [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/))
- The luminance is fixed using [equalisecolourmap.m](https://www.peterkovesi.com/matlabfns/index.html#colour) and related files provided by Peter Kovesi. Note this also depends on [deltaE2000.m](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/~gsharma/ciede2000/).
- The vizualization is done using are RGB to LAB space converion using the colorspace.m and colormapline.m functions from [Matteo Niccoli](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2012/05/12/the-rainbow-is-dead-long-live-the-rainbow-part-1/)
